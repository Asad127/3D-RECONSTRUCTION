**System requirements**
  This toolbox works on Matlab 5.x and Matlab 6.x (up to Matlab 6.5) on Windows, Unix and Linux systems (platforms it has been fully tested) and does not require any specific Matlab toolbox (for example, the optimization toolbox is not required). The toolbox should also work on any other platform supporting Matlab 5.x and 6.x.


**Getting started**

- Go to the download page, and retrieve the latest version of the complete camera calibration toolbox for Matlab.
- Store the individual matlab files (.m files) into a unique folder TOOLBOX_calib (default folder name).
- Run Matlab and add the location of the folder TOOLBOX_calib to the main matlab path. This procedure will let you call any of the matlab toolbox functions from anywhere. Under Windows, this may be easily done by using the path editing menu. Under Unix or Linux, you may use the command path or addpath (use the help command for function description).
- Run the main matlab calibration function calib_gui (or calib).
- A mode selection window appears on the screen:


This selection window lets you choose between two modes of operation of the toolbox: standard or memory efficient. In standard mode, all the images used for calibration are loaded into memory once and never read again from disk. This minimizes the overall number of disk access, and speeds up all image processing and image display functions. However, if the images are large, or there are a lot of them, then the OUT OF MEMORY error message may be encountered. If this is the case, the new memory efficient version of the toolbox may be used. In this mode, every image is loaded one by one and never stored permanently in memory.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65610334/211983174-64161d3e-ad95-41e0-b7f5-759fc5859001.png)

If you choose to run the standard version of the toolbox now, you can always switch to the other memory efficient mode later in case the OUT OF MEMORY error message is encountered. The two modes of operation are totally compatible (for input and output) and interchangeable.

Since both modes have the exact same user interface, in the context of this documentation, let us select the standard mode by clicking on the top button of the window. The main calibration toolbox window appears on the screen (replacing the mode selection window):

Note that the mode selection step can be bypassed altogether by directly running calib_gui(0) for the normal mode or calib_gui(1) for the memory efficient mode (try help calib_gui for more information).

- You are now ready to use the toolbox for calibration.

**Calibration example**

- First calibration example - Corner extraction, calibration, additional tools
    This section takes you through a complete calibration example based on a total of 20 (and 25) images of a planar checkerboard. This example lets you learn how to use all the features of the toolbox: loading calibration images, extracting image corners, running the main calibration engine, displaying the results, controlling accuracies, adding and suppressing images, undistorting images, exporting calibration data to different formats... This example is highly recommended for someone who is just starting using the toolbox.

- From within matlab, go to the example folder calib_example containing the images. 
- From within matlab, go to the example folder calib_example containing the images. 
Click on the Image names button in the Camera calibration tool window. Enter the basename of the calibration images (Image) and the image format (tif).All the images (the 20 of them) are then loaded in memory (through the command Read images that is automatically executed) in the variables I_1, I_2 ,..., I_20.The number of images is stored in the variable n_ima (=20 here).

- Extract the grid corners:
Click on the Extract grid corners button in the Camera calibration tool window.

  **Press "enter" (with an empty argument) to select all the images (otherwise, you would enter a list of image indices like [2 5 8 10 12] to extract corners of a subset of images).**

  Then, select the default window size of the corner finder: wintx=winty=5 by pressing "enter" with empty arguments to the wintx and winty question. 
This leads to a effective window of size 11x11 pixels.

    winty ([] = 26) = 13
    Window size = 27x27**
Do you want to use the automatic square counting mechanism (0=[]=default)
  or do you always want to enter the number of squares manually (1,other)?


The corner extraction engine includes an automatic mechanism for counting the number of squares in the grid. This tool is specially convenient when working with a large number of images since the user does not have to manually enter the number of squares in both x and y directions of the pattern. On some very rare occasions however, this code may not predict the right number of squares. This would typically happen when calibrating lenses with extreme distortions. At this point in the corner extraction procedure, the program gives the option to the user to disable the automatic square counting code. In that special mode, the user would be prompted for the square count for every image. In this present example, it is perfectly appropriate to keep working in the default mode (i.e. with automatic square counting activated), and therefore, simply press "enter" with an empty argument. (NOTE: it is generally recommended to first use the corner extraction code in this default mode, and then, if need be, re-process the few images with "problems")

Ordering rule for clicking: The first clicked point is selected to be associated to the origin point of the reference frame attached to the grid. The other three points of the rectangular grid can be clicked in any order. This first-click rule is especially important if you need to calibrate externally multiple cameras (i.e. compute the relative positions of several cameras in space)

Enter the sizes dX and dY in X and Y of each square in the grid (in this case, dX=dY=13mm=default values):

Follow the same procedure for the rest of images in the dataset.

After corner extraction, the matlab data file calib_data.mat is automatically generated. This file contains all the information gathered throughout the corner extraction stage (image coordinates, corresponding 3D grid coordinates, grid sizes, ...). This file is only created in case of emergency when for example matlab is abruptly terminated before saving. Loading this file would prevent you from having to click again on the images.

During your own calibrations, when there is a large amount of distortion in the image, the program may not be able to automatically count the number of squares in the grid. In that case, the number of squares in both X and Y directions have to be entered manually. This should not occur in this present example.

Another problem may arise when performing your own calibrations. If the lens distortions are really too severe (for fisheye lenses for example), the simple guiding tool based on a single distortion coefficient kc may not be sufficient to provide good enough initial guesses for the corner locations. For those few difficult cases, a script program is included in the toolbox that allows for a completely manual corner extraction (i.e. one click per corner). The script file is called manual_corner_extraction.m (in memory efficient mode, you should use manual_corner_extraction_no_read.m instead) and should be executed AFTER the traditional corner extaction code (the script relies on data that were computed by the traditional corner extraction code -square count, grid size, order of points, ...- even if the corners themselves were wrongly detected). Obviously, this method for corner extraction could be extremely time consuming when applied on a lot of images. It therefore recommended to use it as a last resort when everything else has failed. Most users should never have to worry about this, and it will not happen in this present calibration example.

**Main Calibration step**

After corner extraction, click on the button Calibration of the Camera calibration tool to run the main camera calibration procedure.
Calibration is done in two steps: first initialization, and then nonlinear optimization.
The initialization step computes a closed-form solution for the calibration parameters based not including any lens distortion (program name: init_calib_param.m).
The non-linear optimization step minimizes the total reprojection error (in the least squares sense) over all the calibration parameters (9 DOF for intrinsic: focal, principal point, distortion coefficients, and 6*20 DOF extrinsic => 129 parameters). For a complete description of the calibration parameters, click on that link. The optimization is done by iterative gradient descent with an explicit (closed-form) computation of the Jacobian matrix (program name: go_calib_optim.m).

Aspect ratio optimized (est_aspect_ratio = 1) -> both components of fc are estimated (DEFAULT).
Principal point optimized (center_optim=1) - (DEFAULT). To reject principal point, set center_optim=0
Skew not optimized (est_alpha=0) - (DEFAULT)
Distortion not fully estimated (defined by the variable est_dist):
     Sixth order distortion not estimated (est_dist(5)=0) - (DEFAULT) .
Initialization of the principal point at the center of the image.
Initialization of the intrinsic parameters using the vanishing points of planar patterns.

Initialization of the intrinsic parameters - Number of images: 12

Calibration parameters after initialization:

- Focal Length:          fc = [ 1529.18846   1529.18846 ]
Principal point:       cc = [ 1631.50000   734.50000 ]
Skew:             alpha_c = [ 0.00000 ]   => angle of pixel = 90.00000 degrees
Distortion:            kc = [ 0.00000   0.00000   0.00000   0.00000   0.00000 ]

Main calibration optimization procedure - Number of images: 12
Gradient descent iterations: 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10...done
Estimation of uncertainties...done

Calibration results after optimization (with uncertainties):

- Focal Length:          fc = [ 1507.97898   1496.24779 ] Â± [ 26.82888   26.88096 ]
Principal point:       cc = [ 1536.92900   695.75342 ] Â± [ 38.21710   42.19543 ]
Skew:             alpha_c = [ 0.00000 ] Â± [ 0.00000  ]   => angle of pixel axes = 90.00000 Â± 0.00000 degrees
Distortion:            kc = [ -0.12315   0.13155   0.00248   -0.01555  0.00000 ] Â± [ 0.05752   0.11221   0.00904   0.00697  0.00000 ]
Pixel error:          err = [ 0.23942   0.24756 ]

Note: The numerical errors are approximately three times the standard deviations (for reference).

The Calibration parameters are stored in a number of variables. For a complete description of them, visit this page. Notice that the skew coefficient alpha_c and the 6th order radial distortion coefficient (the last entry of kc) have not been estimated (this is the default mode). Therefore, the angle between the x and y pixel axes is 90 degrees. In most practical situations, this is a very good assumption. However, later on, a way of introducing the skew coefficient alpha_c in the optimization will be presented.

Observe that only 10 gradient descent iterations are required in order to reach the minimum. This means only 10 evaluations of the reprojection function + Jacobian computation and inversion. The reason for that fast convergence is the quality of the initial guess for the parameters computed by the initialization procedure.
For now, ignore the recommendation of the system to reduce the distortion model. The reprojection error is still too large to make a judgement on the complexity of the model. This is mainly because some of the grid corners were not very precisely extracted for a number of images.

Click on Reproject on images in the Camera calibration tool to show the reprojections of the grids onto the original images. These projections are computed based on the current intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Input an empty string (just press "enter") to the question Number(s) of image(s) to show ([] = all images) to indicate that you want to show all the images:
Number(s) of image(s) to show ([] = all images) = 


The following figures shows the first four images with the detected corners (red crosses) and the reprojected grid corners (circles).
